Description
---------------------------
Kiez is a German word refering to a city neighbourhood  within a larger town. 
In Harmburg (and maybe in Berlin as well as other northern Germany area), the word refers to the city's "pub zone" and "red-light district".

Our app is especially designed for those "Kiezzers". We will provide real-time data for nearby pubs------including girls percentage, average age, temperature, humidity------at each specifc moment whenever user searchs. 

Its cool and useful at the same time! Check it out!
